# Discogs Wantlist Marketplace App, made with Python.
A python app which takes your discogs.com want list, obtains marketplace prices per release and writes the results to a CSV file. Useful for data analysis purposes (Kibana works really well for this) :-) 

This program is a hobby project and therefore has **no** warranty, **no** support, **no** license and **no** complaining :-)
Use it for fun, at your own risk and please don't use it for production purposes.

> Requirements: Python 3.x (written on 3.7), requests and xmltodict libraries.

Some parameters in the app require configuration within your discogs.com profile, and you should adjust the User Agent strings as well. For more information about this, I would highly recommend visiting https://www.discogs.com/developers.
