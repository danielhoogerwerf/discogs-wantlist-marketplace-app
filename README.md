# Discogs Wantlist Marketplace App, made with Python.
A Discogs.com Python app which takes your want list, obtains marketplace prices per release and writes the results to a CSV file. Useful for data analysis purposes (Kibana works really well for this) :-) 

This program is a hobby project and therefore has **no** warranty, **no** support, **no** license and **no** complaining :-)
Use it for fun, at your own risk and please don't use it for production purposes.

> Requirements: Python 3, requests and xmltodict libraries.
