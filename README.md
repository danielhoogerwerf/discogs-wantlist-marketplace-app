# Discogs Wantlist Marketplace App, made with Python.
A python app which takes your discogs.com want list, obtains marketplace prices per release and writes the results to a CSV file. Useful for data analysis purposes (Kibana works really well for this) :-) 

This program is a hobby project and therefore has **no** warranty, **no** support, **no** license and **no** complaining :-)
Use it for fun, at your own risk and please don't use it for production purposes.

> Requirements: Python 3.x (written on 3.7), requests and xmltodict libraries.

Some configuration parameters require setup within your discogs.com profile, as well as a proper User Agent string. For more information about this, I would highly recommend to read https://www.discogs.com/developers.
